Shortcode for embedding the Podigee Podcast Player into a post.

== Description ==
A Shortcode to make it easier to embed the Podigee Podcast Player into a blog post by only providing a URL. This also works with free Podigee Accounts or the self-hosted version of the open-source player.

If you have a paid Podigee account and want (a lot) more functionality, like importing show notes and other information into you WordPress posts, please have a look at our more advanced plugin called 'Podigee Wordpress Quick Publish' in the WordPress plugin directory.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' screen in WordPress
